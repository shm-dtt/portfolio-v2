Developer Relations is the intersection between coding, teaching, and community building. It's a space where you can take a love for technology, share it with a community, and help others along the way.

## What do they do?

- **Education:** DevRel teach other developers. Writing blogs, making videos, and building examples. They spread awareness and educate developers about the product. They must be helpful and honest.
- **Product:** DevRel can play a critical role in shaping the product. They can translate developer pain into the product roadmap. This more than product documentation. It's a curiosity for how to improve the [developer experience](/n/dx). They must have empathy for developers.
