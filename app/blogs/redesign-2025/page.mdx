## Why I Redesigned My Portfolio

Over the years, my portfolio has gone through several versions, but they no longer reflected who I am as a developer. So, I decided to redesign it with a focus on **minimalism, performance, and storytelling**.

## Minimalism First

Earlier designs had flashy animations and complex layouts, but they often felt cluttered. This time, I kept things simple:

- **Easy Navigation:** Visitors can find what they need quickly.
- **Clean Design:** White space and clear typography create focus.
- **Purposeful Content:** Every section has a reason to exist.

## Performance Focused

Speed and responsiveness matter. I optimized this version by:

- **Faster Load Times:** Using server-side rendering (SSR) and optimized assets.
- **Fewer Dependencies:** Replacing libraries with lightweight scripts.
- **Responsive Design:** Seamless performance across all devices.
  <br />
  The result? **A faster, smoother experience.**

## Blogging Space

I added a **blog** section to share insights, tutorials, and project stories. It’s a way to document my journey and help others learn.

## What’s Next?

This redesign is just the start. I’ll keep improving it, adding new blogs, and showcasing more projects.

For now, though, I’m happy with how far it’s come. And I’m even more excited about where it’s headed.

## Colophon

Set in **[Inter](https://rsms.me/inter/)**. Built with **[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)**, deployed on **[Vercel](https://vercel.com/)**. Styled using **[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/blog/tailwindcss-v4-beta)**. Version controlled with **[GitHub](https://github.com/)**.

<br />
Inspired by **[Shu Ding](https://shud.in/)**, **[Paco
Coursey](https://paco.me/)**, **[Lee Robinson](https://leerob.com/)**, and
**[Olivier Larose](https://www.olivierlarose.com/)**.
