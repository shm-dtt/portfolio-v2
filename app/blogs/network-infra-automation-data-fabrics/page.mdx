In a world where seamless connectivity is no longer a luxury but a necessity, network infrastructure stands as the silent force powering our digital lives. From video calls and cloud computing to mission-critical operations, it forms the backbone of modern communication and innovation. Yet, as technology evolves, so must the networks that support it.

In an era of unprecedented digital transformation, network infrastructure has transcended its traditional role. 

Modern networks are no longer passive conduits but intelligent, dynamic ecosystems that demand sophisticated management approaches.

Network infrastructure refers to the comprehensive set of hardware, software, networks, and facilities that enable communication, connectivity, and data transmission within an organization or between different organizations. 

It is the foundational framework that allows computers, devices, and systems to connect, communicate, and share resources effectively.

## Why we need automated networks?

Almost every aspect of human life now relies on digital technologies. The networks that power these technologies have become very dynamic and extremely complex. More things are connected and more can go wrong.

But networks are expected to respond instantaneously, scaling to meet petabyte shifts in demand. They also need to provide high levels of service reliability to meet the requirements of many mission-critical processes.

You can't deliver these fast response times and meet other rigorous demands in the network by relying on manual processes. It's time for automated networks.

### Benefits of network automation

Ultimately, network automation helps you create new service opportunities, improve customer satisfaction and reduce costs.

- Improved Network Service Agility: Deploy network services and updates rapidly while responding faster to customer demands
- Greater Operational Efficiency: Reduce costs of repetitive tasks and streamline complex operations.
- Increased Availability: Minimize human errors and system outages to ensure consistent, predictable outcomes.


{/* ### Key network automation technologies

The introduction of network automation is a continuous activity that depends on significant technology innovations. This evolution is driven by a fundamental change from static, hardware-centric networks to dynamic, open and programmable software-centric networks.

The increasing use of software tools that feature less proprietary and domain-specific functionality and abstract network complexity fosters network innovation and enables higher levels of automation. This leads to more efficient operations, faster service implementation and optimized real-time performance.

#### Software-Defined Networking (SDN)
Software-defined networking (SDN) makes it possible to separate the control and data planes. This enables you to programmatically control and manage your network to make it more adaptable and responsive to changing requirements. SDN uses a centralized controller that communicates with the network to optimize traffic flow in real time, allocate resources efficiently and improve network performance.

#### Intent-based networking (IBN)
Intent-based networking (IBN) uses a declarative approach and model-driven management principles to abstract network service characteristics, simplify and automate network and service management, reduce integration efforts and decouple network innovations from service evolution.

Declarative programming drives operations efficiently and consistently. This enables you to focus on your end goals instead of how to achieve them. Programmatic interfaces and data models mediate interaction with network elements to enable multivendor support and rapid onboarding of new equipment releases and types. IBN accelerates service deployment and improves service availability by ensuring the actual configuration is aligned with your intent.

#### Cloud Native Networking
Cloud native networking uses IT-centric tools and techniques to operate the network like software. Every aspect of the network will eventually be coded and programmable, making it easily consumable. Using common tools across all ICT infrastructure (apps, compute, storage and networking) with limited per-domain specialization reduces skillset requirements, fosters innovation and enables greater collaboration. The use of agile NetDevOps processes with continuous integration and deployment is common practice for faster onboarding of new technologies and network functions. */}
